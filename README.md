# Internship_Task 
This project was completed as part of my internship task in Data Analysis. The objective of the task is to clean, analyze, and extract meaningful insights from a given dataset using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

The project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic machine learning/NLP techniques where applicable.

🎯 Objectives

Understand and explore the dataset

Clean and preprocess raw data

Handle missing values and duplicates

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Apply data analysis techniques to extract insights

Visualize results for better interpretation

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas – data cleaning and manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Matplotlib / Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-learn – data splitting and modeling (if applicable)

Jupyter Notebook – development environment

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

Text – textual data (reviews/comments)

Sentiment – sentiment label (Positive, Negative, Neutral)

Timestamp – date and time of the entry

User – user identifier

Platform – source platform

Hashtags – associated hashtags

Retweets – number of retweets

Likes – number of likes

Country – country of origin

Year, Month, Day, Hour – extracted time features

🔄 Steps Performed

Data Loading

Imported dataset using Pandas

Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Corrected data types

Data Preprocessing

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)

Feature extraction from timestamps

Exploratory Data Analysis

Sentiment distribution analysis

Platform and country-based analysis

Visualization of key trends

Modeling (Optional)

Train-test split

Sentiment classification using machine learning

📈 Key Insights

Distribution of sentiments across platforms

Engagement patterns based on likes and retweets

Time-based trends in user activity

Country-wise sentiment comparison

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository or download the files

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Open the Jupyter Notebook

Run cells step by step to view analysis and results

✅ Conclusion

This internship task helped me gain hands-on experience in real-world data analysis, data cleaning, visualization, and basic machine learning techniques. The project strengthened my understanding of how data-driven insights are generated from raw datasets.
